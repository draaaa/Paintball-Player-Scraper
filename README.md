**data scraper developed to get player stats from the [PBLeagues](https://pbleagues.com/) website**

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## IMPORTANT

it seems that keeping track of player stats is a recent thing, or the data for the player stats (starting at 2023 and before) are not accessible, so this means either one of two things

> 1. stop here, and say it's finished (boring)
>> dont really wanna do this, because quitting from one roadblock like this is lame and stupid

> 2. expand the scope, shift the data collection
>> this means either leaving the player stat scraper as it's own thing entirely, and rennovating this code for using team stats instead
>> using team stats will require a login (i think) so this shit is about to get much, much more complex

whether i flip this project on it's head or not, it's been fun to work on it, despite the trials and tribulations and mounts of stress that came with it at first

however, continuing to work on it will only look better for myself

whatever happens now, is completely up to myself

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

personal project, wanted to combine both passion for paintball as a sport and my education in programming

pulls the html content from the target website, and parses the data using BeautifulSoup4
likely will only cover pro league, i might take on the other divisions if i get around to it
